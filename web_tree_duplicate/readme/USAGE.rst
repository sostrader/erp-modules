To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to any tree view
#. select some records
#. open the sidebar menu and click 'Duplicate'

Note that even when selecting all records via the top checkbox on a list, this will only duplicate the currently visible items. If you really need to duplicate all records, you need to adjust the list view limit accordingly.
