16.0.1.0.2 (2023-10-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Add support for oauth2 security scheme in the Swagger UI. If your openapi
  specification contains a security scheme of type oauth2, the Swagger UI will
  display a login button in the top right corner. In order to finalize the
  login process, a redirect URL must be provided when initializing the Swagger
  UI. The Swagger UI is now initialized with a `oauth2RedirectUrl` option that
  references a oauth2-redirect.html file provided by the swagger-ui lib and served
  by the current addon. (`#379 <https://github.com/OCA/rest-framework/issues/379>`_)

* _validator_...() methods can now return a cerberus ``Validator`` object
  instead of a schema dictionnary, for additional flexibility (e.g. allowing
  validator options such as ``allow_unknown``).
