This module prefers kanban sub-form views when using a tablet, or any
other device with a touch screen, no matter its size.

For example, these screenshots showcase a sale order in a tablet:

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because Odoo optimizes views only for mobile
or desktop, but forgets about tablets.

It will be useful for you if you usually use a tablet.

If you need this module for those reasons, these might interest you too:

-  ``web_widget_numeric_step``
-  OCA's ``web_responsive``, or the Odoo EE alternative
   ``web_enterprise`` (closed source).

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Use a tablet.
2. Go to any form that contains a sub-view which can be optimized for
   mobile.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Enable more mobile UI enhancements for tablets as they seem relevant.
-  Allow setting per user or per session, with sane defaults. Just in
   case you happen to use a tablet with a mouse.
