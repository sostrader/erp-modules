This module was developed because Odoo optimizes views only for mobile or desktop, but
forgets about tablets.

It will be useful for you if you usually use a tablet.

If you need this module for those reasons, these might interest you too:

- `web_widget_numeric_step`
- OCA's `web_responsive`, or the Odoo EE alternative `web_enterprise` (closed source).
